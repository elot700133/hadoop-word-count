WordCount program

===============================
Copmilation
===============================
A makefile is provided to compile the word count program.

  $ make 

This will compile with the provided hadoop classpath of the system and create all class files in 
class-folder

Details:
  mkdir -p class-folder
  javac -cp `hadoop classpath` -d class-folder/ WordCount.java
  jar -cvf ./wordcount.jar -C class-folder/ .


===============================
Run
===============================
ssh to compute-0-0

  $ ssh compute-0-0 

run the run.bsh script

  $ ./run.bsh <src> <dst>

in my case, I did:

  $ ./run.bsh /home/to778287/word-count/input /home/to778287/word-count/output13

Details:

  $ hadoop jar <path/to/wordcount.jar> org.myorg.WordCount <input dir> <output dir>


===============================
Design
===============================

The mapper class input is <byteOffset, a line from input file>
The mapper class output is <a word within the line, the filename it was from>
in this case it is of type <Text, Text>

The reducer class input is obviously <Text,Text>
It then tries to find the number of unique filename in the iterator and output 
the result to file with <word, number of files it appears in>
